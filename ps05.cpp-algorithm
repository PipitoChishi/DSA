Write a C++ program that accepts n consecutive natural numbers and checks if any two numbers
are not consecutive by comparing their least significant bits. If two numbers are not consecutive, 
the program should identify the missing number between them.

Algorithm:
Input the n numbers:

Accept n natural numbers from the user.
Convert the numbers to binary using bitset:

Use the bitset to represent the numbers in their binary form, ensuring the numbers are represented in 32 bits.

Check for consecutive numbers:
Compare the least significant bit (LSB) of each pair of consecutive numbers.
If the LSBs of two numbers are the same (either both 0 or both 1), then the numbers are not consecutive.
  
Identify the missing number:
If the two numbers are not consecutive, output the numbers and state that the missing number lies between them.
End the program.
