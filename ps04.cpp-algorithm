Write a C++ program to calculate 
𝑎^𝑛(a raised to the power of n) using fewer iterations than 𝑛.
The program should optimize the calculation by reducing the number of iterations, and should handle both even and odd powers efficiently.

Algorithm:
Start
Declare number, power, and result variables.
Input the values of number and power from the user.
  
Check if power is even:
If true, set increased_value = number * number.
Repeat the multiplication power/2 times and store the result in result.

If power is odd:
Set increased_value = number * number.
Repeat the multiplication (power/2) times and store the result in result.
Multiply the result by number one more time.
Output the value of result.
End.
