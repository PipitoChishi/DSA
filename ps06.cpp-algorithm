Write a program to calculate the number of times the velocity of a ball (falling from a height) needs to be halved before it becomes zero. The program stops when the velocity reaches zero.

Algorithm:
Start the program.

Input the initial velocity:

Prompt the user to enter the initial fall velocity.
Store the value in a variable called velocity.
  
Initialize a counter:
Initialize a variable count to keep track of how many times the velocity has been halved.
  
Halve the velocity repeatedly:
Use a while loop to continuously halve the value of velocity until it reaches zero.
For each halving, increment the count variable to track the number of times the halving operation is performed.

Display the result:
Once the loop ends (i.e., when velocity becomes zero), output the value of count, which indicates the total number of jumps (or halving operations) before the velocity turns zero.
End the program.
