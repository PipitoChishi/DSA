Write a C++ program that accepts n integers from the user, where n is provided by the user. 
The program should find and print the pairs of numbers whose sum matches another number in the array. 
For each such pair, print the indices of the two numbers that sum up to a third number in the array.

Algorithm:
Input the size of the array:
Ask the user to input the number of elements (n).
Input n numbers:

Create an array of size n.
Accept n integers from the user and store them in the array.
Check for pairs whose sum matches a third number:

Use three nested loops:
Outer loop: Iterate over the first number (x).
Middle loop: Iterate over the second number (y), ensuring it is after x.
Inner loop: Iterate over all numbers (z) to check if the sum of numbers[x] and numbers[y] equals numbers[z].
Output the result:

If the sum of numbers[x] and numbers[y] equals numbers[z], print the indices of the numbers (x+1, y+1, z+1).
