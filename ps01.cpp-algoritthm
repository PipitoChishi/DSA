Algorithm:
Input the array:
Take the number of elements, n, and then take n values as the heights of the containers (into an array arr[]).

Initialize variables:
Set max_volume to 0, which will store the maximum volume.
Set two pointers: left at index 0 and right at index n-1.
  
Find the maximum volume:
While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
Calculate the height as the minimum of arr[left] and arr[right].
Calculate the width as right - left.
Calculate the volume as height * width.
Update max_volume if the current volume is greater than the previous max_volume.
Move the left pointer to the right if arr[left] is smaller than arr[right], or move the right pointer to the left if arr[right] is smaller or equal to arr[left].

Calculate the triangle area:
After finding the maximum volume, calculate the base as right - left.
Calculate the height as the absolute difference between arr[left] and arr[right].

Use the formula to calculate the triangle area:
Area=1/2×base×height
Output the results:

Print the max_volume of water that can be stored between two containers.
Print the area of the triangle formed between the two containers.
